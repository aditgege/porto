about:
  title: About Me
  description: |
    I'm a web developer based in Indonesia who enjoys turning ideas into working, polished interfaces.
    My background blends frontend development, UX thinking, and a bit of design sense — mostly learned from experimenting, failing, and learning again.
    I work mainly with Vue and Nuxt, and I like keeping things clean, reusable, and maintainable.
    Outside of coding, I love making zines, photographing everyday things, and growing Astrophytum cacti.

  categories:
    - title: "Work & Skills"
      questions:
        - label: "What do you specialize in?"
          content: |
            I focus on front-end development using Vue 3 and Nuxt, often with TypeScript and composables.
            I enjoy building dashboards, POS systems, and small-scale tools that feel fast and effortless.
        - label: "Do you do design too?"
          content: |
            Yes — but in a practical way. I like designing interfaces that feel natural to use.
            I'm not a full-time designer, but I care a lot about layout, typography, and visual rhythm.
        - label: "Do you take freelance work?"
          content: |
            Occasionally, yes. I prefer small to medium projects that need custom UI and logic rather than generic templates.
            If you have something meaningful and straightforward, I'd be happy to discuss it.
    - title: "Personal & Projects"
      questions:
        - label: "What are you currently working on?"
          content: |
            I'm building a POS system for cafés with focus on simplicity and minimal input — mostly just tapping.
            I'm also learning to refine TypeScript workflows with Zod, and occasionally writing zines about odd things like cacti.
        - label: "What do you do outside of coding?"
          content: |
            I enjoy photography, watching anime like *To Your Eternity*, taking care of my Astrophytum asterias, and doing DIY projects.
            I also love analyzing small, funny, serious things — then turning them into zines.
        - label: "Where do you see yourself next?"
          content: |
            Ideally, I'd like to combine my creative side with web development — maybe through a digital product business or creative studio.
            The goal is to keep learning, experimenting, and making things that feel personal and useful.
